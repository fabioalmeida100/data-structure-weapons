  - Bubble sort: folder `./src/sort_algorithms/bubble_sort.ts`
  - Selection sort: folder `./src/sort_algorithms/selection_sort.ts`

- **Search algorithms**
  - Linear search: folder `./src/search_algorithms/recursive_search.ts`
  - Binary search: folder `./src/search_algorithms/binary_search.ts`

- **Stack**
  - Simple stack: folder `./src/stack_algorithms/simple_stack.ts`

## Why learn about data structures?

Data structures are a way to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. They are essential to solve problems and to create efficient programs.
